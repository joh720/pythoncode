this is my notes for python- beginner python inside sololearn

remember that to add spaces you use the double quotes with the space in between them.
e.g. " "

MATH- remember integers are whole numbers and floats are decimals, for exponents use the ** e.g. (2**5) using exponents with floats e.g. (9 ** (1/2)). 

Floor division is the same as normal division and we express that with the double slashes //. 

For the remainders you use the "modulo operator" aka " % " this will only give you the remainder, so if you want to get both you quotient and the reaminder you should run both on different lines

STRINGS

texts are called strings

when you need a new line add ot the code the \n so you can add a new line. Use the \t to tab the line

use a backslash when wanting to use single quotes in double quotes e.g. ('Brian/'s mother)
you can also use the (\""") to have each line be auto created. Remember to add each string to a different line this just makes it so you dont have to use the ("\n")


concatenation in python works by adding strings together like you would floats and integers e.g.
Print ("spam" + 'eggs')
Print ("2" + "2")

You can multiply strings to integers and it will produce a repeated version of the original string

print("spam" * 3)
print (4 * '2')

the escape characters are the backslashes "\"

variables- only allow letters, numbers, or underscores. cannot use special characters

e.g. users="Jose"
e.g. A_NAME_LAST
e.g. print (users)
e.g. print (users + 3)
e.g. users ="Jose" also users="This is a string" so you enter the two different variables for users as "print (users + "!" )
